## Required Course Materials

### Textbooks

While there will be required readings, we will primarily use open online sources, so that students do not need to purchase a physical textbook.  
Formally, the required textbooks for this course are:
- [Julia Data Science](https://juliadatascience.io/) (Storopoli et al.; online version available for free)
- [Bayesian Statistics using Julia & Turing](https://storopoli.github.io/Bayesian-Julia/) (Storopoli; online version available for free)
- [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html) (Lauwens & Downey; online version available for free)

### Additional resources
Links to additional readings and other online resources will be provided via Canvas.  
Students will also need a computer, modern web browser and high-speed internet access, so students can effectively complete computing assignments and participate in any Zoom classes.
