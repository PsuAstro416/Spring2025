- One common approach is to perform a **sensitivity analysis**, where we repeat the analysis using multiple different priors to see how much the posterior distribution changes.

- Often programs make use of packages of code that provide extra functionality beyond what's in the core language.
- Packages inevitably change, so there are multiple versions. 
- In order to provide a reproducible environment, julia uses `Project.toml` which packages are needed and which versions are allowed.  
- An optional `Manifest.toml` can specify precisely which versions of each package should be used.
- `julia --project=~/Astro416/lab3-eford` would tell julia to start using the environment specified in the directory `~/Astro416/lab3-eford`.  
- `julia --project` uses the environment provided in the current directory.
- `julia -e '1+1` tells to evaluate the quoted program and exit, rather than leaving you in the julia REPL.
- `using Pkg` tells Julia to import the package manager `Pkg` and allow us to direclty access functions exported by that package.
- ` Pkg.instantiate()` tells julita to make sure all the packages specified in the current environment have been installed.

## Bayes Theorem
Start with Law of Conditional Probability:

$p(A,B) = p(A) p(B|A) = p(B) p(A|B)$

OR we might explicitly writeout the asumption of using model $M$:

$p(A,B|M) = p(A|M) p(B|A,M) = p(B|M) p(A|B,M)$

Can compute the marginal probabilities using law of total (conditional) probability:
- Discrete case:
$p(A) = \sum_{i} p(B_i) p(A|B_i)$
$p(B) = \sum_{i} p(A_i) p(B|A_i)$
- Continuous case:
$p(A ) = \int dB \, p(B) p(A|B)$
$p(B ) = \int dA \, p(A) p(B|A)$


To derive Baye's Theorem, substitute: 
- A → $\theta$: model parameters
- B → $D$: observed data 
- [**Prior PDF**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) for model parameters $p(\theta|M)$ for $p(A)$ 
- Likelihood for observed data given model $\mathcal{L} = p(D|\theta, M)$ for $p(B)$
into $p(D, \theta, M )$, the joint probability for both model parameters and observed data given the model $M$.
 
$p(\theta, D, M) = p(\theta | M) p(D | \theta, M ) =  p(D | M ) p( \theta| M, D)$ 

Solve for $p( \theta| M, D)$:

$p( \theta| M, D) = \frac{p(\theta | M) p(D | \theta, M )}{p(D | M )}$

$\mathrm{(Posterior)} = \mathrm{(Prior)} \times \mathrm{(Likelihood)} / \mathrm{(Evidence)}$

## Bayesian Inference
- Bayesian inference about model parameters is based on the [**posterior probability distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability). 
- Ideally, one uses the full posterior distribution.
- Often, is can be helpful to summarize the posterior:  
   + Approximate posterior distribution with a [**Normal Distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
   + Maximunm *a posteriori* Estimator (MAP): $$\hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{MAP}} = \mathrm{argmax}_\theta \, p(\theta ) \, \mathcal{L(\theta )}$$ 
   + Fischer Information Matrix: Curvature of $p(\theta|D,M)$ evaluated at MAP

$I_{i,j} = \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \log p(\theta|D,M) \right|_{\hat{\theta}_{MAP}}$ 
- For many cases if you have a large, high-quality datasets and a model with few parameters, then the posterior distribution may be well approximated by a Gaussian Distribution, and  $\hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{MAP}} \approx \hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{MLE}}$.
- However, there are also plenty of times when:
  + MAP & MLE differ
  + MAP & MLE throws away infortant information about uncertainties.
  + Posterior might not be well approximated by a Gaussian (e.g., skewed, not unimodal).
- We want to build a toolbox that can work in both regimes.
