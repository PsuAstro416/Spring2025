## Exoplanet Examples
- Transits
  - Analyze transit light curves to vet planet candidates from potential astrophysical false positives
  - Analyze transit light curves to inform planning of follow-up observations
- Transit Timing Variations
  - Analyze TTV observations to assess whether TTVs are likely due to known transiting planets or additional unknown  planets
  - Analyze TTV observations to assess whether TTVs are more likely due to dynamical effects or stellar variability.
  - Analyze TTV observations to identify candidates for RV follow-up observations
- Radial Velocity Observations
  - Analyze radial velocity observations to assess whether a planet candidate's orbit is well characterized and ready for publication
  - Analyze radial velocity observations of stars with planet candidates to inform planning of future RV measurements
  - Analyze NEID standard star observations to identify any measurements which are not robust (e.g., comparing RVs derived from each order of the spectra)
  - Analyze NEID solar observations to fit a differential extinction model specific to each day and to assess whether it is adequate to use for subsequent analysis
- Microlensing
   - Analyze microlensing light curves to assess whether a microlensing event shows evidence for a planet or binary star
   - Analyze microlensing light curves to inform planning of follow-up observations
- Other ideas
   - Synthesize observations of host stars being targeted by exoplanet surveys
   - Analyze pyrheliometer data and exposure meter data accompanying NEID solar observations to determine which days observations were likely contaminated by poor atmospheric conditions
