### Creating an Account on Roar Collab

\\

All students should [request an account on Roar Collab](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/account-setup/) before the end of the __first day of class__.  
On the account request form,

- specify ebf11 as the sponsor account,
- write "ebf11 Astro-416  Spring 2025 course" into the research description box
- leave computational and Data Requirements box blank (since they already know what will be required for the class.)  

Students who already have an account on Roar Colab should contact Emery Etter (ece5034@psu.edu) to request that they add your account to the Astro 416 group.

\\

The next step is to [setup your SSH keys](../sshkeys/)
