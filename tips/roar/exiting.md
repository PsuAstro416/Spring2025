# End a Roar Session

If you're ready to submit your assignment, then click the _Ctrl+S/Save all changes_ icon (or press Ctrl+S) to save your changes to that Pluto notebook and see [Starting & Submitting Assignments](/tips/labs/) for instructions.
If you're done (or if you going to take a break of more than an hour), then end your Roar session by:
- Save all changes to notebooks (Ctrl+S)
- Commit any changes to your repository, consider pushing those commits to GitHub.
- From the Jupyter server, close notebook tabs and click the logout icon in in upper right.
- In the Roar Collab Portal, click the "My Interactive Sessions" icon (to the right of Interactive Apps) and click "Delete" for this session and confirm.
