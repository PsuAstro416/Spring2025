Start {{lab3_start}} ---
Due {{lab3_due}}  

### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Build a statistical model from a astrophysical model and measurement process.
- Fit a linear model to data using multipe techniques:
  + Linear Algebra
  + Linear Modeling Package
  + Probabilisitic Programming Language
- Visualize the loss function surface for linear models
- Characterize the sensitivity of results to the choice of prior
- Critically evaluate the uncertainties in model parameters. 

Students will strengthen their astronomical knowledge by:
- Measuring Hubble constant from observations of supernovae
- Detecting transit timing variations for a transiting exoplanet

### Instructions
<!-- - Follow [instructions to start a lab](/tips/labs/starting/) using the following link to [create your Lab 2 starter repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/JL0HDujD) -->  
<!-- REPLACE WITH CODE FOR STARTER REPO -->
- Work through the [ex1.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab3/ex1.html) and [ex2.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab3/ex2.html) (Pluto notebooks) and save updates in your personal repository.
- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)
