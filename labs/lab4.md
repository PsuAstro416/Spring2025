Due {{lab4_due}}  


### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Build a descriptive model based on results of analysis with a simpler model
- Implement a complex physical model within a probabilistic programming language
- Fit a non-linear model to data
- Test the validity of model fitting
- Evaluate the quality of a model fit
- Assess sensitivity to outliers
- Compare the parameters estimated from two models
- Compare the posterior predictive distributions of two models

Students will strengthen their astronomical knowledge by:
- Measuring Hubble constant from observations of supernovae
- Detecting transit timing variations for a transiting exoplanet

### Instructions
<!-- - Follow [instructions to start a lab](/tips/labs/starting/) using the following link to [create your Lab 2 starter repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/CnmDRmu3) -->  
<!-- REPLACE WITH CODE FOR STARTER REPO -->
- Work through the [ex1.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab4/ex1.html) and [ex2.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab4/ex2.html) (Pluto notebooks) and save updates in your personal repository.
- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)
