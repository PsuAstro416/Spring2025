## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Build a classifier from a regression model
- Fit a generalized linear model (i.e., Logistic regression) to data
- Choose threshold to balance rates of false discoveries and false omissions
- Use undersampling to generate a balanced sample
- Estimate parameter uncertainties via K-fold cross validation.

### Instructions

- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)
