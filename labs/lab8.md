Due {{lab8_due}}  


## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Build a classifier from a regression model
- Fit a generalized linear model (i.e., Logistic regression) to data
- Choose threshold to balance rates of false discoveries and false omissions
- Use undersampling to generate a balanced sample
- Estimate parameter uncertainties via K-fold cross validation.
- Train a neural network to classify data
- Improve performance of classifier by increasing size or number of hidden layers
- Test performance using a held-out test set

### Instructions
- Work through the [ex1.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab8/ex1.html) (Pluto notebook) and save updates in your personal repository.  
- Work through the [ex2.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab8/ex2.html) (Pluto notebook) and save updates in your personal repository.  
- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)
