## [Lab {{lab_num}}: {{title}}](https://github.com/PsuAstro416/lab5)

Start {{lab5_start}} ---
Due {{lab5_due}}  

### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Write queries using ADQL and TAP
- Access tables with results of queries
- Download datafiles from a major astronomical archives via astroquery
- Access data from FITS files
- Crossmatch objects between two catalogs
- Wrange data in DataFrames using select, filter, join, groupby & transform
- Access python packages via Julia

### Instructions
- Work through the [ex1.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab5/ex1.html) and [ex2.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab5/ex2.html) (Pluto notebooks) and save updates in your personal repository.  
- Look over [ex3.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab5/ex3.html) and start working on it.  But stop after 6 hours total work on this week's labs.
- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)
