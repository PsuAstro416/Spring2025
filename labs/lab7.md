### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Fit non-parametric model to data
- Apply different regularization terms
- Choose regularization coefficients 
- Anticipate the effects of L2 and L1 regularization
- Use L1 regularization and LASSO for variable selection

### Instructions
- Work through the [ex1.jl](https://psuastro416.github.io/lab6/ex1.html) (Pluto notebook) and save updates in your personal repository.  
- [Commit](/tips/labs/commit) and [submit](/tips/labs/submitting/) your work.
- Once the instrctor and/or TA has provided feedback, [review the feedback](/tips/labs/feedback/)
