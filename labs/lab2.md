### Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Download data from a url
- Read data from a deliminted file into a DataFrame
- Validate that the data was read in correctly
- Describe the basic properties of a dataset
- Make basic plots (histogram, density estimate, scatter plot)
- Peform exploratory data analysis
- Dissaggregate data by a categorical variable
- Recognize the potential impact of missing data and selection effects

Students will strengthen their astronomical knowledge by:
- Visualizing stellar populations on a color-luminosity diagram 
- Exploring distribution of known exoplanets
