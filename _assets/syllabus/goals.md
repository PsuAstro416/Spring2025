## Course Goals 
Successful students in the class will:
- Increase their data acumen, and
- Appreciate how building data science skills can benefit astronomy & astrophysics research.  

## Learning Objectives
Successful students in the class will:
- Ingest and manipulate data from astronomical surveys.
- Build, apply, assess and update astrophysically motivated models for astronomical observations.
- Create visualizations for exploratory and explanatory data analyses of observations from astronomical surveys.
- Synthesize the above into a dashboard to support the efficient analysis of astronomical observations while following principles of reproducible research.

## Course Overview
Students will build practical data science skills (e.g., querying astronomical databases, data storage and manipulation, data visualization, exploratory and explanatory data analysis, Bayesian modeling workflows, and reproducible research practices) and apply these lessons to analyzing data from astronomical surveys.
