## Safety
While attendance and participation in class is important to the class and your learning, it is more important that we all stay safe and healthy.  
All students must follow all health and safety protocols required or recommended by the university.  
University policies and recommendations may change during the semester.  
The most up-to-date information can be accessed at [https://virusinfo.psu.edu/university-status/](https://virusinfo.psu.edu/university-status/).  

As of December 2024, the university policy is:

Stay home and away from others if you are experiencing fever or respiratory symptoms such as but not limited to cough, sore throat, runny nose, chills, fatigue, headache, body aches.
Return to normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, both are true:
- Your symptoms are getting better overall, AND
- You have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication)
Then, take these additional precautions for the next five days to limit the spread of infection:
- Wear a well-fitting mask
- Keep a distance from others and/or
- Get tested to inform your actions to prevent the spread to others
If you begin feeling worse and/or fever returns, stay home and away from others for at least 24 hours until both are true:
- Your symptoms are getting better overall, and
- You have not had a fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication)

If you are unable to attend class, then you can still earn full credit for reading questions and class participation by submitting reading questions prior to class.  
Students should make plans to get a classmateâ€™s notes for any missed class sessions.  
Some class sessions may be moved online, based on community conditions or if the instructor needs to quarantine or isolate.
