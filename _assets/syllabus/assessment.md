### Lab/Homework Assignments
Most weeks, students will have a chance to begin work on a computer lab/homework assignment in small groups.  Homework exercises will typically be due before the start of class on Monday.  Any deviations from this schedule will be announced via Canvas.  If the University is closed on the due date of an assignment (due to holiday or bad weather or any other reason), then the assignment will be due by 10am before the next class session (that is not canceled).  There will be a 10% penalty on assignments submitted after the deadline and up to one week after deadline, and a 20% penalty on assignments submitted more than one week and up to two weeks after the deadline, and a 30% penalty on assignments submitted more than 2 weeks after the deadline.    

### Examination/Quiz Policy
A midterm exam will be taken during one of our regular class times.  The only two conditions under which you can request a makeup exam:
(1) If you know in advance that you will have to miss a midterm exam for a religious observance or university sponsored trip (e.g., athletics, research field work, class field trip), then you must request a makeup midterm in advance of the exam and as early in the semester as possible, to facilitate scheduling.  
(2) If you are injured or ill or in isolation or quarantine during the midterm exam, you should request a makeup exam as soon as practical.  If any of the above cases, documentation may be requested.  Please email the instructor as soon as you are able to request scheduling a makeup exam.
The timing and format of a makeup midterm exam will depend on the circumstances and be at the instructor's discretion.  
For a religious holiday, the instructor would likely recommend taking the same exam early.  For an extended illness, the instructor would likely recommend taking an alternative exam at the end of the class to substitute for the mid-term exam.  
Possible alternative exam formats include (but are not limited to) short answer, essay, or oral exam.

The intent is that most students will *not* take a final exam.  However, the final exam week may be used in unusual circumstances (e.g., in place of the mid-term exam due to an extended illness, need an alternative project format due to accessibility issues).

There maybe short unannounced in-class quizzes during any class session.  
Students should let the instructor know in advance (whenever possible) if they will be unable to attend class due to illness, religious holiday, or university-approved travel, so they can be excused from in-class quizes that day.

### Class Project
Students will synthesize lessons learned in the class by building a “dashboard” that ingests astronomical data, performs basic data manipulations, fits a model to the data, assesses the quality of the model for the given observations, and effectively visualizes the results.  This is a substantive project and students should spread their effort over several weeks of the semester.  To encourage making steady progress, students will earn credit for submitting a plan and demonstrating significant progress for two checkpoints.  Students are encouraged to work in small teams of two to three, so that they can build a high-quality dashboard.  Groups will submit a single dashboard and present their dashboard to the full class during the final weeks of class as a group.  Each student will individually submit a final statement describing their contributions to the dashboard project, describing the contributions of their teammates, and reflecting on what they learned from the experience.  Remember that both you and other group members will have other assignments, exams, and projects.  Therefore, it is very important to develop a mutually agreeable schedule and to follow through on your contributions in a timely fashion.   

### Tophap Questions
All students should submit at least one question per week (e.g., a specific question to clarify something that was unclear to them from that week's class or reading) via [TopHat](https://app.tophat.com/e/003247) no later _9am_ Eastern Time on Friday.  There is also a link to the course TopHat site inside the Canvas webpage.  Submitting your questions well before class starts is important, so the instructor will have time to read the questions and update the day’s lesson to respond to student questions.  You’re strongly encouraged to take a look at questions submitted by other students and give a “thumbs up” to indicate those questions that you’d like to be addressed in class.  Since reading questions can not be made up, each student’s three lowest tophat question scores will be dropped when computing final grades.  Even if you're unable to attend a class, in most cases you can still submit a tophat question to earn credit.  Students who are reluctant to ask questions in class are especially encouraged to ask extra questions prior to class via TopHat.  

Some weeks, students will be assigned a short reading (or video) prior to class.  These weeks, students will also be asked to respond to short reading questions via TopHat no later _9am_ Eastern Time on day that the reading is to be completed by.  Reading assignments will appear in the lesson pages of the website.  

### Lab Participation
In-class computing lab sessions will provide an opportunity to work on lab/homework assignments.  Students should participate regularly, so as to help solidify their understanding of topics from class and to build practical data science skills.  
Gaining experience communicating technical information and working as a team is an important part of the course, so are encouraged to work in small groups.  Attendance will be taken during selected classes (particularly the lab sessions Wednesdays and/or Friday) for the lab participation grade.  If the student is not present when attendance is taken, then they can earn a maximum of half a point for that week’s class participation (even if they arrive later or were participating previously that day).  If you know you need to miss class (e.g., university-approved travel, health issues, isolation or quarantine), then let the instructor know in advance whenever practical, so the absence can be removed from your average.
